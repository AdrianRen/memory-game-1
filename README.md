Memory Game Project
======

## Project Instructions:

#### What Will I Build?
The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating your mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You’ll build a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration). But this isn’t just any memory game! It’s a snazzy, well-designed, and feature-packed memory game!

#### How It Works
If you're unfamiliar with the game, the rules are very simple; flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. Each turn:

* A player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
* If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
